OSCascadeView
=============

iOS control for Cascade Layout customized for iPad screen

Inspired by https://github.com/appunite/CLCascade project.
In this project the new navigation control and interaction shown.
It's usefull when background view requires users interaction too, the best example is map in background.
New views comes from left control sidebar, and every next view appears underneath the previous.
